how to implement celery in a django project

reference: https://testdriven.io/blog/django-and-celery/

modify Dockerfile:
pip install celery and redis

modify docker-compose.yml:
add celery and redis services
celery service is similar to app service, but no ports and different command
celery service depends on app

modify django settings:
add CELERY_BROKER_URL and CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND

in app directory, create tasks.py:
put shared task functions here

in django directory, create celery.py:
this is where the celery app is initialized

in django directory, modify __init__.py:
ensure Celery app is imported when django starts

modify views.py:
put task trigger and status functions here
these functions will call the shared task functions in tasks.py

modify urls.py
add urls that point to the trigger and status functions

in project directory, create logs directory:
create celery.log here, and update the celery command in the docker-compose file
